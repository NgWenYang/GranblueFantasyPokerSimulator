---TL;DR --- 
You get 5 cards and can choose 0 - 5 cards to reshuffle. After shuffle if you have winning hand, you can choose to play Higher-or-Lower to double up rewards if you win, or get nothing if you lose.

1) Poker Rules :
-> Try to make a winning hand category using the 5 cards dealt to you. You can exchange up to 5 cards once per game.
-> There are 4 types of poker tables. Each table has a different number of chips needed to place a bet.
-> This game is between you and the dealer and the aim is to get a winning hand. The better the hand, the better the payout.
-> A 53-card deck is used to play poker. The extra card is a joker and represents any card that gives you the best hand.
-> Win by getting a hand with a combination of Two Pair or better. Combinations that have lower odds return a bigger payout. Nothing is won for a One Pair hand combination.

2) Hand Combinations :

-> Two Pair
   A hand with two groups of two equal ranking cards is a Two Pair combination.
-> Three of a Kind
   A hand with three equal ranking cards is a 3 of a Kind combination.
-> Straight
   A hand with five consecutive cards, regardless of suit, is a Straight combination. Aces can't bridge the gap between a King and a 2; Q-K-A-2-3 is not valid.
-> Flush
   A hand of cards that are all the same suit is a Flush combination.
-> Full House
   A hand containing One Pair and 3 of a Kind is a Full House.
-> Four of a Kind
   A hand with four equal ranking cards is a 4 of a Kind combination.
-> Straight Flush
   A hand of consecutive cards that are all the same suit is a Straight Flush. Aces can't bridge the gap between a King and a 2; Q-K-A-2-3 is not valid.
-> Five of a Kind
   A hand with four equal ranking cards and a joker is a 5 of a Kind combination.
-> Royal Straight Flush
   A hand with 10-J-Q-K-A that are all the same suit is a Royal Straight Flush. If the joker replaces one of these cards, it is a Straight Flush.

3) Higher-or-Lower :
-> You have the option to play Higher-or-Lower when you get a winning combination. If you win, your winnings double. If you lose, you get nothing. There are two types of Higher-or-Lower, one using 2 cards and one using 1 card.
Two cards :
-> Two cards are placed on the table, one facing up and one facing down. Tap High if you think the card facing down is higher than the card facing up, or Low if you think it is lower. If you're correct, you win double.
-> The highest card in 2-Card Higher-or-Lower is an Ace. The lowest is a 2. There are no jokers in the 2-Card Higher-or-Lower deck.
-> 2-Card Higher-or-Lower can be played up to ten times in a row, including ties. 
   It's possible to double up until you reach:
   1500 chips on a 1-chip bet,
   15,000 chips on a 10-chip bet,
   150,000 chips on a 100-chip bet or,
   1,500,000 chips on a 1000-chip bet.   
One cards:
-> 1 card is placed face down on the table. Tap High if you think it is a High card or Low if you think it is a low card. 1-Card Higher-or-Lower can continue as long as the guesses are correct.
-> In 1-Card Higher-or-Lower, cards ranking 2-7 are low and cards ranking 8-king are high. An ace wins regardless of whether you choose High or Low, but a joker automatically loses.
